# Implementation of a TERO-PUF on FPGA

This is my Master Thesis work at **Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles** for the Master's Degree in Electronics and Information Technology
Engineering during the year 2022-2023.

This is about a **Transcient Effet Ring Oscillator Physical Unclonable Function (TERO-PUF)** implementation on **Artix-7 FPGA** (Basys-3 from Diligent). For more informations, see the [report](https://github.com/OscarVsp/MFE-TEROPUF-FPGA/blob/main/report/report.pdf).

The VDHL framework is based on a previous Master Thesis about **Ring Oscillator PUF** that can be found [here](https://github.com/brentdewe/ropuf). Thanks to [brentdewe](https://github.com/brentdewe) for providing the implementation.
