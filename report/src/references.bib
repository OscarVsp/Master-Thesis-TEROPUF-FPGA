	abstract = {Error correction coding for optical communication and storage requires high rate codes that enable high data throughput and low residual errors. Recently, different concatenated coding schemes were proposed that are based on binary {BCH} codes with low error correcting capabilities. In this work, low‐complexity hard‐ and soft‐input decoding methods for such codes are investigated. We propose three concepts to reduce the complexity of the decoder. For the algebraic decoding we demonstrate that Peterson's algorithm can be more efficient than the Berlekamp–Massey algorithm for single, double, and triple error correcting {BCH} codes. We propose an inversion‐less version of Peterson's algorithm and a corresponding decoding architecture. Furthermore, we propose a decoding approach that combines algebraic hard‐input decoding with soft‐input bitflipping decoding. An acceptance criterion is utilised to determine the reliability of the estimated codewords. For many received codewords the stopping criterion indicates that the hard‐decoding result is sufficiently reliable, and the costly soft‐input decoding can be omitted. To reduce the memory size for the soft‐values, we propose a bit‐flipping decoder that stores only the positions and soft values of a small number of code symbols. This method significantly reduces the memory requirements and has little adverse effect on the decoding performance.},

Connecting devices of everyday use can greatly improve our comfort, but it can also introduce unprecedented security problems. With billions of devices connected there is a huge risk of unauthorized use. In this context, Physical Unclonable Functions ({PUFs}) are a promising solution since they extract device intrinsic ﬁngerprint that can be used for hardware identiﬁcation and authentication. Here we present the ﬁrst fully functional implementation of Oscillator based {PUFs} on Flash based {FPGA}.

After explaining those two {PUF} principles, we give all the necessary design practices to follow to obtain an efﬁcient {PUF} implementation on Flash {FPGA}. Finally, we present the characterization of the {PUFs} and compare it to previous work. To the best of our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst work which deals with the implementation of Oscillator based {PUF} on Flash {FPGAs}.

While resistance to {SCA} was indicated for the Transient Effect Ring Oscillator ({TERO}) {PUF}, it was not backed by an actual assessment. To investigate the physical security of the {TERO} {PUF}, we first discuss and study the conceptual behavior of the {PUF} primitive to identify possible weaknesses. We support our claims by conducting an {EM}-analysis of a {TERO} design on an {FPGA}. When measuring {TERO} cells with an oscilloscope in the time domain, a Short Time Fourier Transform ({STFT}) based approach allows to extract the relevant information in the frequency domain. By applying this method we significantly reduce the entropy of the {PUF}. Our analysis shows the vulnerability of not only the originally suggested {TERO} {PUF} implementation but also the impact on {TERO} designs in general. We discuss enhancements of the design that potentially prevent the {TERO} {PUF} from exposing the secret and point out that regarding security the {TERO} {PUF} is similar to the more area-efficient Ring Oscillator {PUF}.},

	abstract = {Industry trends are moving toward increasing use of chiplets as a replacement for monolithic fabrication in many modern chips. Each chiplet is a separately-produced silicon die, and a system-on-chip ({SoC}) is created by packaging the chiplets together on a silicon interposer or bridge. Chiplets enable {IP} reuse, heterogeneousintegration, and better ability to leverage cost-appropriate process nodes. Yet, creating systems from separately produced components also brings security risks to consider, such as the possibility of die swapping, or susceptibility to interposer probing or tampering. In a zero-trust security posture, a chiplet should not blindly assume it is operating in a friendly environment.In this paper we propose a delay-based {PUF} for chiplets to verify system integrity. Our technique allows a single chiplet to initiate a protocol with its neighbors to measure unique variations in the propagation delays of incoming signals as part of an integrity check. We prototype our design on Xilinx Ultrascale+ {FPGAs}, which are constructed as multi-die systems on a silicon interposer, and which also emulate the general features of other industrial chiplet interfaces. We perform experiments on, and compare data from, dozens of Ultrascale+ {FPGAs} by making use of Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud ({EC}2) F1 instances as a testing platform. The {PUF} cells are shown to reject clock and temperature variation as common mode, and each cell produces approximately 5 ps of unique delay variation. For a design with 144 {PUF} cells, we measure the mean within-class and between-class distances to be 68.3 ps and 847.7 ps, respectively. The smallest between-class distance of 686.0 ps exceeds the largest within-class distance of 124.0 ps by more than 5x under nominal conditions, and the {PUF} is shown to be resilient to environmental changes. Our findings indicate the {PUF} can be used for authentication, and is potentially sensitive enough to detect picosecond-scale timing changes due to tampering.},

	abstract = {Physically unclonable functions ({PUFs}) are device-specific digital fingerprints derived from physical properties. They are used in critical cryptographic applications, including unique {ID} generation, key generation, and challenge-response-based authentication. The advantages of low implementation cost and robust operation render {PUF} an indispensable component for secure embedded systems. In the last decade, {SRAM}-based {PUFs} have become very popular in the {ASIC} industry due to increasing security demand against cloning and counterfeiting. However, their use in the {FPGA} applications is limited, since it is almost impossible to power-cycle the {SRAMs} after the {FPGA} device is configured. Additionally, {FPGA} vendors usually clear the {SRAM} contents after power on which also makes it hard to implement an {SRAM} {PUF}. In this work, we propose a new approach for designing {SRAM}-based {PUFs} on Xilinx {FPGAs}. The proposed {PUF} is based on the idea of triggering a collision between reading and writing operations in a block-{RAM} to generate random responses induced by timing violation instead of power cycling. We have integrated the proposed {PUF} as an {AXI} peripheral with a synthesizable processor core for data acquisition. The design has been tested on 10 different Xilinx Artix-7 devices of the same type, and acquired data were tested for reliability, uniqueness, bit-aliasing, and uniformity properties. On the average, the proposed {PUF} achieved 93\% reliability (at 55 \$\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}{\textbackslash}hbox \{C\}\$\$), 37\% uniqueness, 47\% bit-aliasing, and 55\% uniformity.},

These physical one-way functions are inexpensive to fabricate, prohibitively difficult to duplicate, admit no compact mathematical representation, and are intrinsically tamper-resistant.

	url = {https://scholarworks.umass.edu/masters_theses_2/619},
	abstract = {With the ever-increasing demand for security in embedded systems and wireless sensor networks, we require integrating security primitives for authentication in these devices. One such primitive is known as a Physically Unclonable Function. This entity can be used to provide security at a low cost, as the key or digital signature can be generated by dedicating a small part of the silicon die to these primitives which produces a fingerprint unique to each device. This fingerprint produced by a {PUF} is called its response. The response of {PUFs} depends upon the process variation that occurs during the manufacturing process. In embedded systems and especially wireless sensor networks, there is a need to secure the data the collected from the sensors. 
To tackle this problem, we propose the use of {SRAM}-based {PUFs} to detect the temperature of the system. This is done by taking the {PUF} response to generate temperature based keys. The key would act as proofs of the temperature of the system. In {SRAM} {PUFs}, it is experimentally determined that at varying temperatures there is a shift in the response of the cells from zero to one and vice-versa. This variation can be exploited to generate random but repeatable keys at different temperatures. 
To evaluate our approach, we first analyze the key metrics of a {PUF}, namely, reliability and uniqueness. In order to test the idea of using the {PUF} as a temperature based key generator, we collect data from a total of ten {SRAM} chips at fixed temperatures steps. We first calculate the reliability, which is related to bit error rate, an important parameter with respect to error correction, at various temperatures to verify the stability of the responses. We then identify the temperature of the system by using a temperature sensor and then encode the key offset by {PUF} response at that temperature using {BCH} codes. This key-temperature pair can then be used to establish secure communication between the nodes. Thus, this scheme helps in establishing secure keys as the generation has an extra variable to produce confusion. 
We developed a novel {PUF} for Xilinx {FPGAs} and evaluated its quality metrics. It is very compact and has high uniqueness and reliability. We also implement 2 different {PUF} configurations to allow per-device selection of best {PUFs} to reduce the area and power required for key-generation. We also evaluate the temperature response of this {PUF} and show improvement in the response by using per-device selection.},

	abstract = {Hardware security is an essential tool in the prevention of cloning, theft of service and tampering. This security is often based on cryptographic primitives, which use a key that is securely stored somewhere in the hardware. The strength of the security is therefore dependent upon the eﬀort required from an attacker to compromise this key. Since the tools used to carry out attacks on hardware have increased signiﬁcantly over the years, the protection provided by simply storing a key in memory has decreased to a minimum. In order to protect devices against attacks on their keys, Hardware Intrinsic Security ({HIS}) can be used. One of the best known types of {HIS} primitives are Physically Unclonable Functions ({PUFs}). {PUFs} are primitives that extract secrets from physical characteristics of integrated circuits ({ICs}) and can be used, amongst others, in secure key storage implementations. This paper describes the results of our study on two important types of intrinsic {PUFs}, based on {SRAM} and D ﬂip-ﬂops. Both memory types present a speciﬁc start-up pattern (when powered up), which can be used as a {PUF}. For secure practical applications, a {PUF} should possess enough reliability for a single device and enough randomness between diﬀerent devices. In this paper, a general test framework is proposed for measuring this reliability and randomness of both {PUF} types. Based on this framework, tests have been performed on {PUFs} in 65nm {ICs} and results are presented and compared between {PUF} types. From these results it can be concluded that {SRAMs} are slightly outperforming D ﬂip-ﬂop memories when it comes to usage for {PUF} implementations.},

In this work, to address the usage of intrinsic {PUF}, a D flip-flop based lightweight {PUF} is proposed. The proposed architecture is implemented on 40 nm {CMOS} technology. The simulation results show that it offers a uniqueness of 0.502 and the worst-case reliability of 95.89\% at high temperature 125 °C and 97.89\% at a supply voltage of 1.2 V. To evaluate the performance of various {PUF} architectures, A novel term, the uniqueness-to-reliability ratio, is proposed. When compared to the conventional D flip-flop, it offers 4.491 times more uniqueness and 127.74 times more uniqueness-to-reliability ratio with the same layout area. Since it uses the symmetrical structure, unlike other architectures, the proposed architecture does not require any postprocessing schemes for bias removal, which further saves the silicon area. To verify the functional correctness of the simulation results, an {FPGA} implementation of the conventional and proposed D Flip-flop is also presented.},

	abstract = {Physically unclonable functions ({PUF}) are digital ﬁngerprints which generate high entropy, temper-resilient keys and/or chip-identiﬁers for security applications. When considering the miniaturized hardware development for the Internet of Things ({IoT}), security is of high importance. In this case, {PUF} designing using {SRAM} or D ﬂip-ﬂops are quite common but with compromised uniqueness due to the limited silicon area. In this work, a symmetric tri-state D ﬂip-ﬂop based lightweight {PUF} is proposed with increased uniqueness. The proposed architecture is implemented using a standard 40 nm {CMOS} technology. The post-layout simulation results show that it offers a uniqueness of 0.4994, which is the highest among all the considered architectures. Compared to the Arbiter {PUF} the proposed architecture has 0.267 Â, 0.064 Â, and 0.043 Â less, power, silicon area, and energy per bit, respectively. Similarly, when compared with the Ring Oscillator {PUF}, the proposed architecture has 0.017 Â, 0.031 Â, and 0.0005 Â less, power, silicon area, and energy per bit, respectively. Also, unlike other ﬂip-ﬂop based {PUF}, the proposed one does not require any post-processing block to remove the bias, thus contributes to saving the total implementation area and power of the system. An {FPGA} implementation is also presented as a proof-of-concept to verify functional correctness. For a better performance comparison among the considered architectures, a novel ﬁgure of merit ({FOM}) considering power, reliability, delay, silicon area, and uniqueness has been proposed, and it is observed that the proposed architecture offers the highest {FOM} among considered {PUF} architectures.},

	abstract = {With the ever-increasing demand for security in embedded systems and wireless sensor networks, we require integrating security primitives for authentication in these devices. One such primitive is known as a Physically Unclonable Function. This entity can be used to provide security at a low cost, as the key or digital signature can be generated by dedicating a small part of the silicon die to these primitives which produces a fingerprint unique to each device. This fingerprint produced by a {PUF} is called its response. The response of {PUFs} depends upon the process variation that occurs during the manufacturing process. In embedded systems and especially wireless sensor networks, there is a need to secure the data the collected from the sensors. 
To tackle this problem, we propose the use of {SRAM}-based {PUFs} to detect the temperature of the system. This is done by taking the {PUF} response to generate temperature based keys. The key would act as proofs of the temperature of the system. In {SRAM} {PUFs}, it is experimentally determined that at varying temperatures there is a shift in the response of the cells from zero to one and vice-versa. This variation can be exploited to generate random but repeatable keys at different temperatures. 
To evaluate our approach, we first analyze the key metrics of a {PUF}, namely, reliability and uniqueness. In order to test the idea of using the {PUF} as a temperature based key generator, we collect data from a total of ten {SRAM} chips at fixed temperatures steps. We first calculate the reliability, which is related to bit error rate, an important parameter with respect to error correction, at various temperatures to verify the stability of the responses. We then identify the temperature of the system by using a temperature sensor and then encode the key offset by {PUF} response at that temperature using {BCH} codes. This key-temperature pair can then be used to establish secure communication between the nodes. Thus, this scheme helps in establishing secure keys as the generation has an extra variable to produce confusion. 
We developed a novel {PUF} for Xilinx {FPGAs} and evaluated its quality metrics. It is very compact and has high uniqueness and reliability. We also implement 2 different {PUF} configurations to allow per-device selection of best {PUFs} to reduce the area and power required for key-generation. We also evaluate the temperature response of this {PUF} and show improvement in the response by using per-device selection.},

From {TVs} to smartphones, including vehicles, buildings, and household appliances, everything is interconnected in what we call the "Internet of Things" ({IoT}). {IoT} is now part of our life and we have to deal with it. More than 10 billion devices are already connected and ﬁve times more are expected to be deployed in the next ﬁve years. While deployment and integration of {IoT} is expanding, one of the main challenge is to provide practical solutions to security, privacy and trust issues in {IoT}. Protection and security mechanisms need to include features such as interoperability and scalability but also traceability, authentication and access control while remaining lightweight. Among the most promising approaches to such security mechanisms, physical unclonable functions ({PUF}) provide a unique identiﬁer for similar but different integrated circuits using some of their physical characteristics. These types of functions can thus be used to authenticate integrated circuits, provide traceability and access control. This paper presents a comprehensive case study of the transient effect ring oscillator ({TERO}) {PUF} from its implementation on {FPGAs} to its complete characterization. The implementation of the {PUF} is detailed for two different families of {FPGAs}: Xilinx Spartan 6 and Altera Cyclone V. All the metrics used for the characterization are explained in detail and the results of the characterization include robustness to environmental parameters including variations in temperature and voltage. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained for another {PUF}: the ring oscillator ({RO}) {PUF}. All the design ﬁles are available online to ensure repeatability and enable comparison of our contribution with other studies.},

The arbiter {PUF} (A-{PUF}) is one of the most well-known {PUF} circuits. However, its {FPGA} implementation has a poor reliability, and error correction codes ({ECCs}) are usually needed to eliminate the noise in the responses, which incur additional high hardware overhead and require {NVM} for helper data storage. In this paper, we present a highly reliable arbiter {PUF} with improved uniqueness using the bit-self-test ({BST}) strategy. A delay detection circuit is added into a classical arbiter {PUF} to test the delay deviation that produces each bit of the {PUF} response in real-time and mark the response as reliable using a reliability flag when the delay deviation is significantly more than a predefined threshold. Then, the robust responses can be used. We implemented the {BST}-arbiter {PUF} on a Xilinx Artix 7 {FPGA}. The test results show that the selected responses achieve outstanding performance where the bit error rate is less than 10-9, the bias is 50.3\%, and the uniqueness is 49.1\%. Thus, the {BST}-{APUF}, which drastically reduced the {ECC} overhead, can be applied to lightweight cryptography applications.},

Regrettably, issues about energy use and the lack of computing resources limit the cryptographic methods that can be implemented on these devices. Moreover, the conventional use of non-volatile memory for storing secret keys are vulnerable to a number of attacks like reverse-engineering, cold-boot, side channel, device tampering, etc. Physical Unclonable Functions ({PUFs}) are one of the categories for enhancing physical device security and solving issues involving with the use of traditional cryptographic algorithms. {PUFs} are associated as lightweight one-way functions used to extract a unique identity for each end-device, based on physical factors introduced during manufacturing which are unforeseeable and unclonable. {PUFs} are promising hardware security primitive and have seen a lot of attention in the past few years. In this paper, we provide a survey of a large range of {PUF} schemes proposed in the literature. Our comparison analysis of the surveyed schemes ends with a number of observations. Then we propose a new scheme of Arbiter {PUF} to create an identity for each {IoT} device. The proposed scheme is resistant to Machine Learning ({ML}) attacks.

However, many diﬀerent successful attacks have already revealed vulnerabilities of certain digital intrinsic {PUFs}. Although settling-state-based {PUFs}, such as {SRAM} {PUFs}, can be physically cloned by semi-invasive and fully-invasive attacks, successful attacks on timing-based {PUFs} were so far limited to modeling attacks. Such modeling requires a large subset of challenge-response-pairs ({CRP}) to successfully model the targeted {PUF}. In order to provide a ﬁnal security answer, this paper proves that all arbiter-based (i.e. controlled and {XOR}-enhanced) {PUFs} can be completely and linearly characterized by means of photonic emission analysis. Our experimental setup is capable of measuring every {PUF}-internal delay with a resolution of 6 picoseconds. Due to this resolution we indeed require only the theoretical minimum number of linear independent equations (i.e. physical measurements) to directly solve the underlying inhomogeneous linear system. Moreover, we neither require to know the actual {PUF} challenges nor the corresponding {PUF} responses for our physical delay extraction. On top of that devastating result, we are also able to further simplify our setup for easier physical measurement handling. We present our practical results for a real arbiter {PUF} implementation on a Complex Programmable Logic Device ({CPLD}) from Altera manufactured in a 180 nanometer process.},

	abstract = {Hardware security modules play a crucial role in protecting and preserving technologically integrated systems that are used in daily life. They employ cryptographic protocols to secure a system against adversaries. Generally, cryptographic algorithms and security keys are quintessential for maintaining the security of a system. Cryptography uses a secret key to encipher and decipher the data. These secret keys are stored in a non-volatile memory that attackers can easily access. The hardware security primitive, Physical Unclonable Function ({PUF}) is a promising alternative for enhancing the security of interconnected devices. A {PUF} produces an output in response to an input based on the physical structure and intrinsic manufacturing variations of an integrated circuit ({IC}). The generated random response being unpredictable, act as a robust secret key in cryptographic protocols. The first silicon {PUF} is the Arbiter {PUF}, which can instantly produce significantly more secret keys based on the input with a lightweight design. Due to its advantage, it is best suited for device authentication in resource-constrained applications employing the Internet of Things ({IoT}). The {PUF} is also suitable for applications such as the Internet of Vehicles, the Internet of Medical Things, {RFID} (radio frequency identification) tags, and smart cards. In this paper, the basic Arbiter {PUF} design is implemented in {ZedBoard} to analyze the {PUF} performance characteristics for 16, 32, and 64-bit responses. A review of Arbiter {PUF} design, different compositions of Arbiter {PUF}, their individual characteristics, and vulnerabilities against machine-learning attacks have been presented at their broader best in this paper.},

This paper presents a contactless and local active attack on ring oscillators ({ROs}) based {TRNGs} using electromagnetic ﬁelds. Experiments show that in a {TRNG} featuring ﬁfty {ROs}, the impact of a local electromagnetic emanation on the {ROs} is so strong, that it is possible to lock them on the injected signal and thus to control the monobit bias of the {TRNG} output even when low power electromagnetic ﬁelds are exploited. These results conﬁrm practically that the electromagnetic waves used for harmonic signal injection may represent a serious security threat for secure circuits that embed {RO}-based {TRNG}.},

	abstract = {{IP} protection of hardware designs is the most important requirement for many {FPGA} {IP} vendors. To this end, various solutions have been proposed by {FPGA} manufacturers based on the idea of bitstream encryption. An alternative solution was advocated in [18]. Simpson and Schaumont proposed in [18] a new approach based on Physical Unclonable Functions ({PUFs}) for {IP} protection on {FPGAs}. {PUFs} are a unique class of physical systems that extract secrets from complex physical characteristics of the integrated circuits which along with the properties of unclonability provide a highly secure means of generating volatile secret keys for cryptographic operations. However, the ﬁrst practical {PUF} on an {FPGA} was proposed only later in [7] based on the startup values of embedded {SRAM} memories which are intrinsic in some of the current {FPGAs}. The disadvantage of these intrinsic {SRAM} {PUFs} is that not all {FPGAs} support uninitialized {SRAM} memory. In this paper, we propose a new {PUF} structure called the Butterﬂy {PUF} that can be used on all types of {FPGAs}. We also present experimental results showing their identiﬁcation and key generation capabilities.},

Our mathematical analysis shows that both architectures behave identically when composed of the same number of rings and ideal logic components. However, the reduction of the number of rings, as proposed by Wold and Tan, would inevitably cause the loss of entropy in their generator. Unfortunately, this entropy insufﬁciency is masked by the pseudo-randomness caused by {XOR}-ing clock signals having different frequencies. Our simulation model shows that the generator using more than 18 ideal jitter-free rings having slightly different frequencies and producing only pseudo-randomness, will always let the statistical tests pass. We conclude that smaller number of rings reduces the security, if the entropy reduction is not taken into account in post-processing. Moreover, the designer cannot avoid that some of rings will have the same frequency, which will cause another loss of entropy. In order to conﬁrm this, we show how the attacker can reach a state where more than 25 \% of the rings are locked and thus completely dependent. This effect can have disastrous consequences on the security of the system.},

	abstract = {Physical Unclonable Functions ({PUFs}) are expected to represent an important solution for secure {ID} generation and authentication etc. In general, manufactured {PUFs} are considered to be more secure when the pattern of outputs (the variety of responses) is larger, i.e., the response bit length is longer (e.g., 192-bit response is more secure than 128-bit one). However, the actual bit length is reduced because some response bits are inconsistent (random) for repeated measurements, which are regarded as unnecessary for {ID} generation and discarded. Latch-based {PUFs} with \$\$N\$\${RS} latches, for example, generate ideally \$\$2{\textasciicircum}\{N\}\$\$responses depending on binary values output from {RS} latches (0/1). However, some {RS} latches output random responses which are inconsistent and cannot be used for reliable {ID} generation, so the variety of responses becomes smaller than \$\$2{\textasciicircum}\{N\}\$\$. In this paper, we propose a novel Latch-based {PUF} structure, which outputs larger variety of responses by utilizing location information of the {RS} latches outputting the random responses. Differently from random responses themselves, this location information is determined during a manufacturing process, so almost fixed once {PUFs} are manufactured. The proposed {PUF} generates \$\$3{\textasciicircum}\{N\}{\textbackslash}approx 2{\textasciicircum}\{1.58N\}\$\$responses by considering random responses as the third stable value: using ternary values (0/1/random). We estimate the variety of responses generated by the proposed {PUFs}. According to our experiment with 40 {FPGAs}, a Latch-based {PUF} with 128 {RS} latches can improve it from \$\$2{\textasciicircum}\{116\}\$\$to \$\$2{\textasciicircum}\{192.7\}\$\$, this being maximized when the 128 latches outputs 0s, 1s, or random outputs with equal probability. We also show the appropriate {RS} latch structure for satisfying this condition, and validate it using two kinds of different Xilinx {FPGAs}: Spartan-3E and Spartan-6. The average error rate of responses is only 5.3 \% when the core voltage is changed within the rated voltage range of the {FPGAs}. Our proposed {PUF} using ternary values enhances dramatically the variety of responses while keeping the reliability.},

	abstract = {Severe security threats and alerts associated with the use of smart devices have drawn increasing public attentions since the inception of Internet of Things ({IoT}) in late 1990s. {IoT} devices pose a unique and challenging scenario for hardware security because of their ubiquity and area-power cost constraints. Traditional software techniques and established cryptographic methods are either inadequate or impractical due to the computational capacity and permanent storage required to process and maintain the privacy of the secret key. In this light, Physical Unclonable Function ({PUF}), a burgeoning technology rooted in 2002, comes in handy as an inexpensive and yet effective security primitive to overcome the forgery tagging problem by its radically different way of generating and processing secret keys in security hardware. {PUFs} are hardware structures or functions designed to utilize the physical disorder of random nanoscale phenomena for the derivation of keys without having to keep any security-critical information explicitly in hardware. As we usher {PUF} into its 15th anniversary in 2017, it is timely to review the advancements of {PUF} over the past decade. Specifically, this survey addresses three fundamental questions which are at all times relevant in the security arms race. These questions are: how secure can a {PUF} be? what differences have {PUFs} brought to security applications and how do these differences impact existing security protocols? how is hardware implementation research influenced by the opportunities of nanotechnologies and new discoveries of disorder-based physical phenomena? It is hoped that this retrospective study of problems and solutions encountered in the journey of developing {PUF} to its current state will foreshadow the challenges and opportunities for future sustainable activities in the field.},

Also, our proposed area-efficient {PUF} architecture has low complexities and hence consumes low power consumption as compared to the counterparts. Moreover, we investigate the impact of systematic variation on the uniqueness of the response bits. We have used an optimized placement (in term of area cost) for the proposed structure and implemented our proposed scheme on the Spartan3 {FPGA} boards. The implemented structure demonstrates considerable performance metrics such as the uniqueness of 49.32\%. In addition, the proposed structure provides higher reliability when tuned with {PDLs}.

	abstract = {Physical Unclonable Functions ({PUFs}) enable the generation of device-unique, on-chip, and digital identiﬁers by exploiting the manufacturing process variation. The past decade has seen an extensive eﬀort in {PUF} design. Yet, most {PUF} constructions are regarded as stand-alone hardware building blocks. In contrast, we propose {PUF} constructions that are tightly integrated into the design of a micro-processor. The proposed {PUFs} are essentially a collection of time-to-digital converters that are integrated into the custom instruction or memory-mapped interface of a processor. Therefore, the processor can issue the {PUF} challenges and collect the associated responses using instruction executions. This integration enables practical, run-time physical authentication and it allows ﬂexible post-processing mechanisms using software. In this article, we describe the design, implementation, and the performance analysis details of such hardware/software co-designed authentication mechanisms on {FPGAs}. We propose two variants of the {PUF} architecture: a synchronous module that requires minimal place and route constraints utilizing the common clock of the {SoC}, and an asynchronous alternative that is independent of the clock but realized with a controlled placement. We implemented the synchronous architecture on the Altera Cyclone-{IV} {FPGAs} and performed a large-scale characterization on 55 boards. The asynchronous design is realized on the Xilinx Virtex-5 {FPGAs} and tested on 100 boards. Measurements reveal that the proposed solutions can authenticate trillions of devices and provide better performance than the ring oscillator based alternative.},

Especially, the methods are constrained by power consumption and an insufficient of computing capacity. Moreover, the customary method of keeping secret keys in non-volatile memory is susceptible to assaults like side-channelling and reverse engineering. Physical Unclonable Functions ({PUFs}) are a technique for improving security of physical device and resolving difficulties with current cryptographic algorithms. {PUFs} are simple operations that force each terminal to have a unique personality based on physical characteristics imposed during production that are unpredictable and impossible to replicate. The focus of this work is on {XOR} arbiter {PUF} ({XORAPUF}) architecture with the three factors: reliability, uniqueness, and uniformity. Experiments show that the proposed {XORAPUF} implemented on field programmable gate array ({FPGA}) achieves inter-chip hamming distance ({HD}) closer to 50\% with excellent uniqueness and uniformity of 49.88\% and 48.74\%, respectively. The reliability of the designed {PUF} is also optimized to 99.20\%. On comparing the designed {PUF} metrics results with conventional {PUF}, the {XORAPUF} circuit generated better results.},

	abstract = {The device authentication of {IoT} nodes is very important since they are mainly deployed in open unsecure environment. Physical Unclonable Function ({PUF}) is a fingerprint of chip and may be useful to solve the hardware security issues in {IoT} network. This fingerprint is based on the inevitable physical variations that occur during the manufacturing of the device and is useful for generating cryptographic keys. These variations are random in nature and extracted through Challenges–Response Pairs. However, the responses of the device are subjected to change in the environmental condition such as temperature variations, humidity alteration, aging effect and voltage variations. The paper presents reliable {PUF} solution using an efficient error correction scheme. The main contribution of the paper is to design a secure and effective self-error correctable {PUF} for tiny {IoT} nodes. The systematic Golay code and decoding algorithm are applied with {PUF} for improvement of the reliability in {IoT} applications. The hardware implementation of Golay code based error correction along with {PUF} is performed on {FPGA} board to validate the proof of concept as reliable hardware security solution. The proposed design has good performance with 45\% uniqueness and 97\% of reliability using efficient error correction mechanism. The hardware results show that our proposed self correcting {PUF} based solution would suited for small sensors in various {IoT} applications.},

	abstract = {The advent of the Internet of Things has enriched the network field with new themes, among which we find the Internet of Vehicles ({IoV}). {IoV} improved the various smart traffic applications for management or security. It makes vehicles autonomously deal with the unexpected by sharing various resources like critical information, computing resources, etc. Nonetheless and as a user of current network technologies, {IoV} suffers from the same vulnerabilities of these technologies, which makes it vulnerable to various kinds of attacks that affect security and privacy. To overcome these new challenges, researchers have considered different {IoV} authentication protocols. However, most of them are compromised and contain real security problems. Dealing with {IoV} authentication protocol security flaws is a real challenge. Recently, Jiang et al. (Comput Commun 173:45–55, 2021) designed a three-factor authentication protocol for {IoV} environment. The proposed protocol combines lightweight operations that include elliptic curve cryptography, hash function, physically unclonable function, concatenation on one side, and {XOR} operation on the other side. Contrariwise, it contains several flaws. In this paper, we detailed the security analysis of Jiang et al. protocol that proves the limit of security guarantees between only user and data center due to the possibility for an adversary to deduce a session key shared between vehicle sensor and data center and between vehicle sensor and user. Moreover, regarding these limitations, we propose an improvement to remedy all the said security pitfalls.},

	abstract = {Physical unclonable functions ({PUFs}), which exploit uncontrollable and unpredictable randomness of materials or devices, have been investigated as a hardware-based security primitive owing to their robustness against adversarial attacks. Spin–orbit torque ({SOT}) switching is one of the promising techniques for {PUF} applications because it can provide randomness by the stochastic switching distribution of perpendicular magnetization. In this study, the improvement in the reliability of {SOT}-based {PUFs} against external magnetic fields with write-back operation ({WBO}) is demonstrated. A {PUF} consisting of 8 × 4 array Hall-bar devices with a Ta/{CoFeB}/{MgO} structure is fabricated, where the random distribution of the {SOT} switching current serves as an entropy source. However, the information stored in the {PUF} is easily modified by the application of an external magnetic field. To improve the robustness against magnetic fields, a {WBO} is introduced that applies an additional current to saturate the magnetization in either the upward or downward direction depending on the magnetic state. As a result, the {SOT}-based {PUF} maintains an entropy value close to unity under a magnetic field of up to the coercive field of the {CoFeB} layer. Furthermore, the {WBO} provides a digitalized output, which potentially reduces peripheral circuitry such as analog-to-digital converters.},

The {PUF} labels can be conformally attached onto the surface of complex shaped objects, providing the desired protection against fake and interior products. In this system, silk fibroin films serve as a flexible and biocompatible substrate, while the Raman signal of the microdiamonds serves as response of the excitation. The extremely high stability and random distribution of the microdiamonds ensure the performance of {PUFs}, and the maximum encoding capability of 210000 is finally realized. The cytotoxicity analysis results also verify the biosafety of the {PUF} system. In addition, the as-prepared {PUF} labels are attached onto the surface of polyethylene material, and human skin, and even have been implanted under chicken skin tissue, promising their practical applications.},

The secret of the {PUF} is stored into a random state of a matrix of perpendicular {SOT}-{MRAMs}. Here, we show experimentally and with micromagnetic simulations that this random state is driven by the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of the free layer of the memory excited by the {SOT}. In detail, a large enough current drives the magnetization along an in-plane direction. Once the current is removed, the in-plane magnetic state becomes unstable evolving toward one of the two perpendicular stable configurations randomly. In addition, we propose a hybrid {CMOS}/spintronics model to simulate a {PUF} realized by an array of 16 × 16 {SOT}-{MRAM} cells and evaluate the electrical characteristics. Hardware authentication based on this {PUF} scheme has several characteristics, such as {CMOS}-compatibility, non-volatility (no power consumption in standby mode), reconfigurability (the secret can be reprogrammed), and scalability, which can move a step forward the design of spintronic devices for application in security.},

The proposed Delay Difference {PUF} ({DD}-{PUF}) is the most dense {FPGA}-compatible {PUF} ever reported in the literature, allowing the implementation of two {PUF} bits in a single slice and provides very good values for all the most important ﬁgures of merit. The architecture of the proposed {PUF} exploits the delay difference between two nominally identical signal paths and the metastability features of D-Latches with an asynchronous reset input. The {DD}-{PUF} has been implemented on both Xilinx Spartan-6 and Artix-7 devices and the resulting design ﬂows which allow to accurately balance the nominal delay of the different signal paths is outlined. The circuits have been extensively tested under temperature and supply voltage variations and the results of our evaluations on both {FPGA} families have shown that the proposed architecture and implementation are able to ﬁt in just 32 Conﬁgurable Logic Blocks ({CLBs}) without sacriﬁcing steadiness, uniqueness and uniformity, thus outperforming most of the previously published {FPGAcompatible} {PUFs}.},

The switch component structure of the improved scheme adopts the parallelconnected mode to improve the uniqueness of the circuit, which avoids the cross-connected mode unable to achieve symmetrical layout on {FPGA}. At the same time, the improved scheme uses lookup tables to construct the structure of programmable delay line ({PDL}) with a multiplexer ({MUX}), which can reduce the internal resource consumption of slice while receiving the same 64-bit challenges. The improved scheme was tested on {FPGA} boards, the uniqueness and steadiness of different switch component schemes are compared and analyzed, and the feasibility of the improved scheme is verified. The results show that in the generation of Arbiter {PUF}, compared with the conventional scheme, the improved scheme reduces the resource consumption and improves the uniqueness by 22.2\%; Compared with the {MUX} + {MUX} scheme, the improved scheme saves 50\% of resource consumption while maintaining good uniqueness.},

The {XOR} Arbiter {PUF} ({XOR} {PUF} or {XPUF}) is an intensively studied {PUF} invented to improve the security of the Arbiter {PUF}, probably the most lightweight delay-based {PUF}. Recently, highly powerful machine learning attack methods were discovered and were able to easily break large-sized {XPUFs}, which were highly secure against earlier machine learning attack methods. Component-differentially-challenged {XPUFs} ({CDC}-{XPUFs}) are {XPUFs} with different component {PUFs} receiving different challenges. Studies showed they were much more secure against machine learning attacks than the conventional {XPUFs}, whose component {PUFs} receive the same challenge. But these studies were all based on earlier machine learning attack methods, and hence it is not clear if {CDC}-{XPUFs} can remain secure under the recently discovered powerful attack methods. In this paper, the two current most powerful two machine learning methods for attacking {XPUFs} are adapted by fine-tuning the parameters of the two methods for {CDCXPUFs}. Attack experiments using both simulated {PUF} data and silicon data generated from {PUFs} implemented on field-programmable gate array ({FPGA}) were carried out, and the experimental results showed that some previously secure {CDC}-{XPUFs} of certain circuit parameter values are no longer secure under the adapted new attack methods, while many more {CDC}-{XPUFs} of other circuit parameter values remain secure. Thus, our experimental attack study has re-defined the boundary between the secure region and the insecure region of the {PUF} circuit parameter space, providing {PUF} manufacturers and {IoT} security application developers with valuable information in choosing {PUFs} with secure parameter values.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07019},
	abstract = {In most {PUF}-based authentication schemes, a central server is usually engaged to verify the response of the device’s {PUF} to challenge bit-streams. However, the server availability may be intermittent in practice. To tackle such an issue, this paper proposes a new protocol for supporting distributed authentication while avoiding vulnerability to information leakage where {CRPs} could be retrieved from hacked devices and collectively used to model the {PUF}. The main idea is to provision for scrambling the challenge bit-stream in a way that is dependent on the veriﬁer. The scrambling pattern varies per authentication round for each device and independently across devices. In essence, the scrambling function becomes node- and packetspeciﬁc and the response received by two veriﬁers of one device for the same challenge bit-stream could vary. Thus, neither the scrambling function can be reverted, nor the {PUF} can be modeled even by a collusive set of malicious nodes. The validation results using data of an {FPGA}-based implementation demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in thwarting {PUF} modeling attacks by collusive actors. We also discuss the approach resiliency against impersonation, Sybil, and reverse engineering attacks.},

Delay based {PUFs} forms one of the popular category among different kinds of {PUFs} wherein the interconnect and gates delays due to uncontrollable manufacturing deviations are exploited to generate secret keys. However some of the designs such as arbiter and butterfly {PUFs} are seldom implemented in {FPGA} due to higher component of routing delay in comparison to random delay. This research work focus on the design of Hybrid {PUF} using the concepts of Butterfly and Arbiter {PUF} to reduce the skew delay factor in these {PUFs}. The proposed structure combines the benefits of both {PUFs} to increase the randomness and accuracy of the arbiter {PUF}.

A novel post-characterisation methodology is also proposed that improves the reliability of a {PUF} without the need for any additional hardware resources. Moreover, the proposed post-characterisation method can be generally used for any {FPGA}-based {PUF} designs.

It is a promising candidate to improve security in lightweight devices targeted at {IoT} applications due to its low cost nature. The Arbiter {PUF} or {APUF} has been widely studied in the technical literature. However it often suffers from disadvantages such as poor uniqueness and reliability, particularly when implemented on {FPGAs} due to physical layout restrictions. To address these problems, a new design known as {FF}-{APUF} has been proposed; it offers a compact architecture, combined with good uniqueness and reliability properties, and is well suited to {FPGA} implementation. Many {PUF} designs have been shown to be vulnerable to machine learning ({ML}) based modelling attacks. In this paper, initial tests show that to attack the {FF}-{APUF} design requires more effort for the adversary than a conventional {APUF} design. A comprehensive analysis of the experimental results for the {FF}-{APUF} design is presented to show this outcome. An improved {APUF} design with a balanced routing, and the proposed {FF}-{APUF} design are both implemented on an Xilinx Artix-7 {FPGA} at 28 nm technology. The empirical min-entropy of the {FF}-{APUF} design across different devices is shown to be more than twice that of the conventional {APUF} design.},
